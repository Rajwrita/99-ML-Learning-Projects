# Exercise goal
- Implement a simple code to train a Text Generation model using Keras and TensorFlow to produce a brand new Arctic Monkey song!

# Data
- The file `AM.txt` (see [./data/AM.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimseng/99-ML-Learning-Projects/master/004/data/AM.txt)).
- The data has been collected by combining the lyrics of multiple [Arctic Monkey songs](https://www.arcticmonkeys.com/). You can also form your own data set by combining the lyrics of songs from your favorite artists. The dataset should have a decent number of lines, you can follow the data set provided with this exercise to understand the format.

# Task
- Tokenize the text.
- Create a simple neural network with LSTM layer to train on text.
- Use some seed text as input to the trained network to generate new lyrics.
